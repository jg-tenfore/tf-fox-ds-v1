/**
 * Registration rules — who can sign up for a clinic or lesson, what they're asked, and
 * the buy-several discount.
 *
 * Fox's Instructions & Clinics tool already lets a course set all four on a clinic
 * (fox.tenfore.golf/dunes/clinics): an age range, a gender setting (Male, Female or
 * Any), custom questions at sign-up, and "Buy 3 get 50% off" — which takes its percent
 * off the whole registration, not off one session. The MCG prototype had none of them — a clinic was a
 * quantity stepper and a lesson only asked juniors for an age. This module is the one
 * definition both clinics (`events-catalog.ts`) and lessons (`instruction-catalog.ts`)
 * hang their rules on, so the two sign-up paths can't drift apart.
 *
 * Pure data and pure functions: no React, no imports. The UI lives in
 * `registration/registration-ui.tsx`.
