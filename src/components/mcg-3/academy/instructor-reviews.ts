/**
 * Instructor reviews — **Tenfore verified post-lesson reviews**, with sample content.
 *
 * ## Where reviews come from
 *
 * Not Google, and not an open comment box. After a lesson booked through Tenfore is
 * marked complete, the golfer who took it gets one short prompt (email + account
 * activity) to rate it. Only that golfer, only for that lesson, only once. That is what
 * "verified" means on the page: every review is tied to a real completed booking.
 *
 * ## The three rules the Academy controls
 *
 *  1. **Optional per instructor.** An instructor (or the Academy on their behalf) can
 *     turn reviews off. Off means no rating, no count and no reviews block on the
 *     profile — not an empty one. Prompts aren't sent for their lessons either.
 *  2. **A minimum before anything shows.** No rating is published until an instructor
 *     has `REVIEW_MINIMUM` verified reviews. Below that the profile says reviews are
 *     being collected, so one bad afternoon can't define a pro who just joined, and a
 *     handful of reviews can't be traced back to the golfers who wrote them.
 *  3. **Moderated before publishing.** Staff can hold a review that names another
 *     golfer or isn't about the lesson. Held reviews still count toward the rating.
 *
 * ## The content is still sample data
 *
 * The roster is real, named Montgomery County employees and none of this is real
 * feedback about any of them. The copy stays about the *lesson experience* (booking,
 * setup, pacing, notes), authors are initials only, and the averages are deterministic
 * and pinned to 4.5–5.0. Any screen that renders it must show `SAMPLE_REVIEW_NOTICE`.
